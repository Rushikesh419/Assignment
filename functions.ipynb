        "We evaluate a standard machine learning classification model using various evaluation metrics. A classification model is a model which classifies a given observation or an event to a fixed set of categories. Suppose I train a machine learning model to classify images of cats and dogs. For each image, the machine classifies the image with either a 'Cat' or a 'Dog'. So in essence for each input image, there is a corresponding output by the model. This output can either be a 'Cat' or a 'Dog'.\n",

        "Accuracy defintion : Suppose you are given 20 input images of cats and dogs. You already know from these images that there are 11 cats and 9 dogs. You train a machine learning model to classify these images into cats and dogs. The machine predicts 9 cats correctly and 8 dogs correctly. The accuracy of the model is then defined as (correctly predicted cats and dogs)/(total cats and dogs). In this case it is (9+8)/(11+9) = 17/20 = 0.85 or 85%. It is a good practice to report the accuracy in percentages\n",
